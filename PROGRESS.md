# 🚀 Teyro Development Progress Tracker
> **IMPORTANT:** The company name is now **Teyro**. The codebase currently uses "Upskiill" throughout - rebranding will happen when the logo arrives.

> **Rule:** We complete 100% of a Pillar before proceeding to the next one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT PRODUCTION BACKEND RULE:** The Front-end MUST ALWAYS point to the production backend (`https://upskiill-backend.onrender.com`). NEVER point to the local backend on `localhost:3001` ever, even during local development and testing. This is a foundational code-based rule and principle.
> 
> **STRICT BRANCHING RULE:** All work must always be pushed to a new branch for Pull Requests (PR) and Code Review before merging. We never push directly to main.
> 
> **STRICT COMPONENT SYSTEM RULE:** All UI components use the established design system with 10px rounded corners, 48px input height, and brand colors. New pages MUST utilize the shared component library (`components/ui/*` and `components/features/*`) to maintain design coherence across the entire application.

## 🔄 Waitlist Strategy - Separate Project

> **Note (2026-04-12):** The waitlist landing page will be built as a **separate Next.js project** in a different GitHub repo.

- **Domain**: Teyro.app (to be acquired)
- **Phase 1 (July 2026)**: Beta Launch — Waitlist members get early access to the platform, insider insights, and testing.
- **Phase 2 (August 2026)**: Official Phase 1 MVP Launch — Teyro.app points to the main project.
- **Development**: Continue using upskiill.vercel.app for main app development/testing.

### Step A — Finish Feature Components (Phase 3) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Build Global responsive `<Header />` Component
- [x] Build `HeroSection` (Pillar of immensity)
- [x] Build `CategoryCard` & `CourseCard` UI
- [x] Build `InstructorCard` & `ReviewCard`
- [x] Build `CertificateCard` — `components/features/CertificateCard.tsx`
- [x] Build `LessonItem` — `components/features/LessonItem.tsx`
- [x] Build `SectionAccordion` — `components/features/SectionAccordion.tsx`
- [x] Build `CartItem` — `components/features/CartItem.tsx`

### Step B — Build Waitlist Landing Pages (Phase 4) ✅ COMPLETE
> **🛑 CRITICAL DECISION:** We pivoted from the core marketplace to build a high-converting Waitlist Homepage first, inspired by Scribe UI (dark themes, purple glows, micro-animations).
> **Update (2026-04-15):** The waitlist components have been updated with a **High-End Interactive Revamp** (Cinematic interactions) and pushed to `feat/teyro-landing-page-interactive`.
- [x] `HeroSection` (Scribe dark gradient, floating badges)
- [x] `StatsSection` (Magnificent **Stacking Cards** deck interaction — *perfected native scroll translation via Framer Motion*)
- [x] `ProblemsSolutions` (**Exploded View Assembly** scroll-mapped interaction)
- [x] `WhyTeyro` (**Horizontal Ticker Scroll** — *perfected edge-to-center mathematical scroll-linking to guarantee mobile, tablet, and desktop flawlessly stop precisely on the final CTA*)
- [x] `RoleSolutions` (**Sticky Split-Scroll** dynamic content crossfade)
- [x] `Marketplace` (Monetized **SVG Journey Line** animated S-curve)
- [x] `FAQSection` (Animated accordion)
- [x] `FinalCTA` (Dark shimmer glowing button)
- [x] **Interactive Revamp & GitHub Push**: All waitlist sections updated with premium scroll animations. ✅
- [x] **Mobile Responsiveness Fixes**: Bottom-sheet style `RoleModal`, proper `overflow-x: clip` bug fixing for broken `position: sticky` implementations globally.
- [x] **Domain Migration & SEO**: Whitelisted `teyro.app` in backend CORS, populated `layout.tsx` with full SEO keywords + OG Meta for production.
- [x] **Isolated Waitlist Footer**: Added a dedicated `WaitlistFooter.tsx` (dark theme, isolated links, block socials). Added global HTML ID anchors (`#features`, `#faq`) to restrict navigation completely to the landing page.
- [x] **Tally Form Full-Page Architecture**: Securely integrated the waitlist form. Deleted the redundant `<RoleModal />` to stream users directly to a native 100vh embedded Tally frame hosted locally on `/join`. All waitlist buttons route instantly.
- [ ] **Pending: Live Counter Webhook** — Need to write the Next.js API route to receive Tally webhook submissions to automatically increment the Supabase counter.

### Step C — Build Marketplace Pages ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `/courses` Browse UI (Responsive Grid + Search + Filter Sidebar) ✅ **DONE (Mobile Polished)**
- [x] `/courses/[id]` Course Detail/Sales Page ✅ **DONE (Mobile Polished)**

### Step D — Build Course API & Core Systems ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `GET /courses` — list published courses (search & filter params)

- [x] SEO-Friendly Slugs ( dual-lookup by ID or Slug)
- [x] Production Deployment (PR #46 Recovery)
- [x] **Cart & Checkout System**: Implemented `OrdersModule` with simulated checkout and enrollment logic. ✅
- [x] **Guest Checkout**: Enabled checkout for unregistered users with auto-account creation. ✅

- [x] **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Fixed async params unwrapping in dynamic routes ✅
- [x] **Production API Switch**: All frontend pages updated to fetch from `https://upskiill-backend.onrender.com`. ✅
- [x] **Cross-Domain Auth Fix (PR 48)**: Renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`, configured auth fetches to `/api`. ✅
- [x] **Marketplace Smart CTAs**: Browse (`/courses`) and Details (`/courses/[id]`) natively detect enrollment ownership, morphing "Buy Now" into "Continue Learning". ✅
- [x] **Vercel Build Stability**: Rectified TypeScript Type Checks surrounding dynamically assigned components (`CoursePlayerLayout`). ✅
- [x] **Firebase Auth Robustness**: Fortified NestJS `ValidationPipe` to securely parse `FirebaseLoginDto` ensuring `idToken` payload is never stripped during social sign-on. ✅
- [x] **Dashboard Render Stability**: Guarded Prisma JSON arrays against corrupted strings preventing fatal Next.js "dark screen" hydrated errors rendering for seeded users. ✅
- [x] **Global Auth Header State**: Revamped `Header.tsx` to instantly sync with JWT state exposing a dynamic Profile/Avatar interactive dropdown with fully stylized mobile navigation. ✅

- [x] **Dynamic Enrollment Architecture**: Established `GET /api/auth/me/enrollments`. Dashboard securely queries sessions and maps live progress into `CourseCardHorizontal`. ✅
- [x] **Build the Full Enrollment System**: Secured `/api/courses/:id/progress` & `/complete-lesson` against unauthorized pinging. Engineered automated integer parsing converting watched videos to 100% logic tracked in Prisma. 
- [x] **Course Lock Screen**: Integrated full-screen UI barricade catching any backend 403 Forbidden checks, routing illegal `/learn/[id]` attempts safely to `/courses/[id]`.
- [x] **Premium Dual-Payment Integration (Deployed — Untested 🟡)**: Stripe (Cards/Apple Pay/Google Pay) and MeSomb (MTN/Orange/Express Union/Wave) live keys injected into Render + Vercel. Build passes. **Needs end-to-end live transaction test.**
