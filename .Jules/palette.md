## 2026-05-23 - [Accordion ARIA & Focus States]
**Learning:** When building an accordion with `overflow: hidden` on the wrapper to handle content animations, traditional `outline: 2px solid` for focus states gets clipped. Additionally, screen readers need explicit ARIA bindings (`aria-controls`, `id`, `role="region"`, `aria-labelledby`) between the trigger and content to understand the relationship, and decorative icons (like chevrons) inside triggers should be explicitly hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"`.
**Action:** Use `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px <color>` for the `:focus-visible` state on the trigger button to prevent clipping. Always ensure proper ARIA linkage between interactive triggers and their expanding regions.

## 2024-05-31 - [aria-expanded on Navigation Toggles]
**Learning:** Mobile hamburger toggles that open/close navigation panels often have aria-label but miss aria-expanded. This attribute is critical as it tells screen readers the current open/closed state of the menu dynamically.
**Action:** When implementing responsive headers, always ensure the mobile menu toggle button binds its `aria-expanded` state to the same boolean used to render the nav panel.

## 2026-06-13 - [Form Validation Error Accessibility]
**Learning:** Relying solely on color to indicate form validation errors violates WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color). Screen readers may also not announce dynamically appearing error messages if they are not properly designated.
**Action:** Always include a visual indicator (like an icon) alongside the error text, use `role="alert"` on the error container for dynamic screen reader announcements, and ensure proper layout using flexbox.
